6 Agrobacterium tumefaciens is a bacterium that can enter plants through wounds
disease known as crown gall disease.
The bacterium attaches to the surface of cells and inserts a small circular DNA molecule,
as a plasmid, into the cell. Some of the genes on the plasmid code for proteins that cause chan
in the plant cell and result in the formation of a plant tumour, or gall.
(a) Outline the changes that occur during tumour formation.
(b) Bacteria that enter the stem through a wound can reach the root of the plant to cause damage.
Suggest how the bacteria are able to reach the root of the plant.
