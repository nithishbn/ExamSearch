(c) At high altitudes, the partial pressure of inspired oxygen is considerably lowe
level. This means that the partial pressure of oxygen in the blood is also much lo
altitudes than at sea level.

With reference to Fig. 3.2, calculate the difference in percentage saturation of haemoglobin
at sea level, where the partial pressure of oxygen is 13.0 kPa, and at a higher altitude, where
the partial pressure of oxygen is 6.2 kPa.

(d) After spending time at altitude, a person can become acclimatised. One feature of
acclimatisation is an increase in the red blood cell count.
Explain the importance of the increase in the red blood cell count.
