# How to use this piece of code
First off, start by running scrap.py in order to grab ALL the pdfs from PapaCambridge.
This is essential because otherwise you won't be able to use this code at all.

## The Main point of this code
* Grab any multiple choice pdf filePath and feed it through `pdfToText()`
* run `getMultipleChoiceQuestions()` in order to, well, get the multiple choice questions
* Run `tagImage()` in order to get image tags for each question into a database
* finally, you may run `search()` in order to search for questions!

*Happy studying!*
